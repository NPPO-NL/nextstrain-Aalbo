# Tracking the introductions of the Asian tiger mosquito *Aedes albopictus*

### Background

The Asian tiger mosquito, *Aedes albopictus*, is an undesirable invasive mosquito species that causes considerable nuisance by its biting behaviour, and the species has been proven to transmit more than 22 different viruses under laboratory conditions. The introduction and establishment of *Ae. albopictus* represent a risk to public health due to the ability to transmit vector‐borne diseases. Recently, established populations of *Ae. albopictus* in southern Europe have been involved in outbreaks of dengue and Chikungunya.

*Aedes albopictus* has a native range that includes Japan, China, northern India, and parts of Southeast Asia and several islands in the Pacific and the Indian Oceans. Due to global trade and human-aided transportation the species has expanded its distribution range to all continents of the world except Antarctica.

Since 2010, *Ae. albopictus* has been found each year in The Netherlands during routine exotic mosquito species surveillance at companies that import used tires and, in Lucky bamboo greenhouses, and sporadically in other Points of Entry such as airports or flower auctions. Furthermore, from 2016 *Ae. albopictus* specimens have been notified by citizens every year at in residential areas in different municipalities.

### Tracking the mosquito vector populations using mitogenomic sequences

Mitogenomic variation can be used for phylogeography analysis of *Ae. albopictus*. Nextstrain, a collection of open-source bio-informatic tools, is used to create an interactive view of the diversity and spread of the mosquito species. For more information read the paper by Ibáñez-Justicia A, van de Vossenberg BTLH, *et al.* (2021) Tracking Asian tiger mosquito introductions in the Netherlands using Nextstrain (in preparation)

The Nextstrain build contains complete *Aedes albopictus* mitogenomes and associated metadata of specimens found introduced in the Netherlands and from specimens from populations from other regions in the world. These specimens were sampled between 2014 and 2020 and represent 16 countries covering three continents. Origin of specimens isolates can be visualized on different geographical levels (i.e continent, country, state, and municipality or town) when this information is available.

**Please note** that central coordinates (or an approximation thereof) are used for the different geographical levels in this build.



#### Contribute to the build

The reliability of a track and trace tool depends on sampling and metadata completeness. Sharing data for inclusion in this interactive online tool will enable the vector entomology field to better understand and communicate the diversity and spread of this important invasive mosquito species. Organizations are invited to share data or materials for inclusion in the build. Updates will be communicated via Resource Announcements to which contributing organizations are invited as co-author.


You can contribute to the build by providing preferably *Ae. albopictus* specimens from the origin area in Asia, or providing Illumina sequence datasets or assembled mitogenomes together with relevant metadata to the National Reference Centre (NRC), which is part of the Netherlands Food and Consumer Safety Authority [(NVWA)](https://english.nvwa.nl). In case you'd like to contribute to the build, please contact us by email using the following [link](mailto:pdcmv@minlnv.nl).

### Versions

[**28 July 2021**](https://nextstrain.nrcnvwa.nl/Aedes/20210728) 
Shows 254 mitogenomes sampled between June 2014 and October 2020 representing 16 countries. Information on the sampling location, pathway of introduction (PoE) and the haplogroup concept published by Battaglia et al. ([2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5120106/)) are provided. In addition a simplified haplogroup concept is presented.
